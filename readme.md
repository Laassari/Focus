A chrome extension to help focus on work in intervals using the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

You can customise the focus time, rest time and extended rest time.

By default it's set so you work in 40 minutes intervals and rest for 5 minutes and a 15 minutes extended rest period after 4 consecutive focus times.
